How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I feel like i have the basic understanding of an array but realize there is much more that can be
done with them. (moderately confident)

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I can't really say for sure what I dont know and what will come in handy but maybe sone of the phrases or ruby code that i can use to make them easier to navigate.

What questions do you have about Arrays?
I cant think of any right now. I just need to practice them and find a useful way to use them.
